# Starlify-io frontend 

This is a "masther thesis" for my studies at Medieinstitutet. The purpose of the project was to find a headless CMS fulfilling my requirements. The project was made for Entiros Starlify, and is version 0.1.

The backbones of the project will be used as a template for future production ready websites, togheter with the headless CMS. To help content creators and marketers to make changes independant from developers.

## Run app live
